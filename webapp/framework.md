### Preamble

I wrote this doc to keep and share what I know about web frameworks. I'm unable find websites, blogs, or documents that describe web frameworks in detail. I would like to change this state by providing information on the fundamentals of web frameworks. Currently web frameworks are a bit of mystery to me, so I've made it to document what I know. If something in this doc is incorrect feel free to correct it. I hope that I can grow this doc into something of substance for those who want to learn about web frameworks
